# ICESat-2 Bathymetry Extraction Script

This repository contains a Python script for automatically extracting bathymetry from ICESat-2 data. The script is based on the methods outlined in the [ICESat-2 Hackweek 2023 tutorial](https://icesat-2-2023.hackweek.io/tutorials/bathymetry/bathymetry_tutorial.html). By using the date and orbit number of the ICESat-2 data, the script can automatically extract bathymetric data for a study area and supports batch extraction of bathymetric information.
